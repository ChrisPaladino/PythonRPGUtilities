## How to Play

### Setup Phase

1. **Big Picture**: Describe your history in 1-2 sentences
2. **Bookend Periods**: Create the Start and End periods that frame your timeline
3. **Palette**: Add items to the Yes (must exist) and No (cannot exist) lists
4. **First Pass**: Add some initial Periods and Events to flesh out the timeline

### Play Phase

1. **Declare Focus**: Choose a theme, question, or element to explore
2. **Make History**: Create Periods, Events, or Scenes related to your Focus
   - **Periods**: Large spans of time
   - **Events**: Specific occurrences within a Period
   - **Scenes**: Detailed explorations with questions and answers
3. **Complete Focus**: When you're done exploring
4. **Create Legacy**: (Optional) Mark something important from your exploration
5. **Explore Legacy**: Create content related to your Legacy
6. Repeat with new Focus

### Creating Scenes

Scenes follow a structured wizard:
1. **Question**: What will this scene answer?
2. **Set the Stage**: Where and when does it take place?
3. **Characters**: Who's involved?
4. **Play/Dictate**: Act it out or narrate what happens
5. **Answer**: Answer the original question

## Design Philosophy

This application follows the principle of **rule enforcement, not content generation**:

- ✅ Enforces game rules and structure
- ✅ Tracks state and constraints
- ✅ Guides with prompts and instructions
- ❌ Does NOT generate content automatically
- ❌ Does NOT use AI to create story elements
- ❌ Does NOT replace player creativity

All creative content comes from YOU, the player. The app simply provides structure and keeps you honest to the rules.

## Tips for Solo Play

1. **Be disciplined with Focus**: Each Focus should genuinely guide your choices
2. **Respect the Palette**: The constraints spark creativity
3. **Answer Scene questions honestly**: Don't pre-decide outcomes
4. **Embrace non-chronology**: Jump around to wherever interests you
5. **Let Legacies emerge**: Don't force them; create them when something feels significant
