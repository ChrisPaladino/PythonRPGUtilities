# Microscope Solo Play - Step-by-Step Tutorial

**Welcome to Microscope!** This guide will walk you through your first game.

## What is Microscope?

Microscope is a game where you build epic histories spanning centuries or millennia. You don't play it in chronological order - instead, you jump around in time, zooming in and out like a fractal.

Think of it like building a Wikipedia article about a fictional history, but way more fun!

## Important First Steps

### Before You Start

**This app enforces rules and structure, but YOU create all the content.**
- No AI will write your story
- No automatic generation
- Your creativity drives everything

**Be prepared to:**
- Spend 1-3 hours on your first game
- Take your time and think creatively
- Save your game often (File → Save Game)

---

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: The Big Picture (2 minutes)

**What to Do:**
Write 1-2 sentences describing your ENTIRE history.

**Think Big:**
- Centuries, millennia, or even longer
- Rise and fall of civilizations
- Epic journeys across space or time
- Grand themes and transformations

**Examples:**
```
"The rise and fall of the Martian Empire, from the first colonists 
to the final transmission before the Long Silence."

"A thousand-year magical curse placed on the Kingdom of Aethel  
and the heroes across generations who fought to break it."

"Humanity's first steps into the solar system and the devastating 
war with the Belt that nearly destroyed our species."
```

**Your Turn:**
Just write your Big Picture. Don't overthink it - you'll fill in details later!

---

### Step 2: Bookend Periods (5 minutes)

**What to Do:**
Create TWO Periods that frame your timeline:
1. **START Period**: How does your history begin?
2. **END Period**: How does your history end?

**Each Period Needs:**
- **Title**: Short, evocative (3-6 words)
- **Description**: What happens during this era?
- **Tone**: Light ☀️ (hopeful, positive) OR Dark 🌑 (ominous, tragic)

**Example START Period:**
```
Title: First Contact
Description: Humanity discovers the ruins of an ancient alien 
civilization buried beneath Mars' surface, sparking a golden age  
of exploration and discovery.
Tone: Light ☀️
```

**Example END Period:**
```
Title: The Long Silence  
Description: One by one, the colony worlds go dark. Earth receives  
a final cryptic transmission, then... nothing.
Tone: Dark 🌑
```

**Tips:**
- Make them contrast! A light start and dark end (or vice versa) creates tension
- Don't explain HOW you get from start to end - that's what the game is about!
- Be specific enough to spark ideas, but vague enough to leave room

---

### Step 3: The Palette (5 minutes)

**What to Do:**
Create two lists of constraints:

**YES List** - Things that MUST exist in your history
**NO List** - Things that CANNOT exist

**Why?**
Constraints spark creativity! The Palette:
- Prevents contradictions
- Forces interesting solutions
- Makes your history feel coherent

**Example YES List:**
-Advanced AI
- Interstellar travel
- Ancient alien artifacts
- Corporate control of space
- Generational colony ships

**Example NO List:**
- Faster-than-light communication
- Time travel
- Benevolent aliens
- Easy terraforming
- Mind uploading

**Tips:**
- Add 3-5 items to each list
- Be specific: "telepathy" is better than "magic"
- You can work around them creatively later!
- These are locked after setup - choose wisely

---

### Step 4: First Pass (10-15 minutes)

**What to Do:**
Add skeleton content to your timeline:
- **Periods**: 2-3 more time spans between your bookends
- **Events**: 1-2 specific happenings per Period

**What's a Period?**
A large chunk of time - decades, centuries, eras
- Has a title and description
- Has a tone (Light or Dark)
- Contains Events

**What's an Event?**
A specific thing that happens
- MUST have a visible outcome/consequence  
- Happens within a Period
- Has title, description, and tone

**Example Period:**
```
Title: The Golden Age of the Belt
Description: Asteroid mining transforms the solar system's economy.  
The Belt colonies grow wealthy and independent.
Tone: Light ☀️
```

**Example Events (inside "Golden Age" Period):**
```
Event 1:
Title: The Ceres Accord
Description: Belt colonies sign a mutual defense pact, alarming Earth.
Tone: Light ☀️

Event 2:  
Title: First Strike on Vesta
Description: An Earth destroyer fires on Vesta Station. War begins.
Tone: Dark 🌑
```

**Tips:**
- Don't fill in everything - leave LOTS of gaps!
- Jump around in time - you don't have to go chronologically
- You can add more during the main game

**When Done:**
Click "Complete First Pass" - now the real game begins!

## Main Game: The Focus Loop

The main game is a repeating cycle:

### Phase A: Declare Focus (2 minutes)

**What to Do:**
Choose ONE thing to explore this round:
- A theme
- A question
- A specific element, character, or place

**Examples:**
- "The origins of the AI rebellion"
- "What happened to Earth?"
- "The mysterious Precursors"
- "How ordinary people survived the war"

**Rules:**
Everything you create this round MUST relate to your Focus somehow.

---

### Phase B: Make History (15-30 minutes)

**What to Do:**
Create 2-4 pieces of content related to your Focus:

**You Can Create:**

**1. PERIOD** - Another span of time
- Click a Period to select where to insert the new one
- It goes BETWEEN the selected Period and the next one
- Fill in those gaps!

**2. EVENT** - Something that happens
- Click a Period first to select it
- The Event goes inside that Period
- Must have a clear outcome

**3. SCENE** ⭐ - Zoom WAY in to a specific moment
- This is the heart of Microscope!
- Click an Event first
- You'll go through a 5-step wizard...

---

### Creating a Scene (The Magic Part!)

Scenes are where you roleplay/narrate specific moments. Here's the process:

**Step 1: The Question**
What do you want to know?
```
Example: "How did the peace talks fall apart?"
```

**Step 2: Set the Stage**
Where/when is this happening?
```
Example: "The conference hall on Ceres, three hours into negotiations,  
as Earth's delegation receives an urgent message."
```

Choose: **Played** (you roleplay it) OR **Dictated** (you narrate it)

**Step 3: Characters**
Who's involved?
```
Example:  
- Ambassador Chen (Earth)
- Director Kovac (Belt)
- Captain Torres (Earth Military)
```

**Step 4: Play It Out**
- If **Played**: Roleplay the scene, taking on character roles  
- If **Dictated**: Narrate what happens

Take notes if you want!

**Step 5: Answer the Question**
Based on what happened, answer your original question.
```
Example Answer: "Captain Torres interrupts with false intelligence  
about a Belt attack, causing the ambassador to storm out. Torres  
sabotaged the peace talks to keep the war going."
```

**The Scene is Complete!**

---

### Phase C: Complete Focus (1 minute)

When you've explored your Focus enough (2-4 creations), click "Complete Focus"

---

### Phase D: Create Legacy (Optional, 2 minutes)

**What to Do:**
Did something important emerge? Something you want to revisit later?

**If YES**: Create a Legacy
- Describe what's significant
- It gets bookmarked for later

**If NO**: Skip it!

**Example Legacy:**
"Captain Torres' role in sabotaging peace - who was he working for?"

---

### Phase E: Explore Legacy (5 minutes)

If you created a Legacy, quickly explore it:
- Create one Event OR dictated Scene related to it

Then you're done with this round!

---

## Repeat the Loop!

Go back to Phase A and declare a new Focus. Keep going until:
- You've answered your big questions
- The timeline feels complete
- You're satisfied with your history

**There's no fixed endpoint** - play as long as you want!

## Tips for Solo Play

### Creative Tips
1. **Surprise yourself** - Don't pre-plan everything
2. **Ask genuine questions** in Scenes - don't know the answer yet!
3. **Embrace contradictions** - Then explain them!
4. **Jump around** - Don't go chronologically
5. **Zoom in and out** - Mix big Periods with intimate Scenes

### Practical Tips
1. **Save often** (File → Save Game)
2. **Take breaks** - Fresh perspective helps
3. **Export to Markdown** when done for a readable version
4. **Don't stress about the Palette** - Work around it!
5. **First game = learning game** - It gets easier!
