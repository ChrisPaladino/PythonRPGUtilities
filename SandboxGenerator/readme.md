# Biomes
### Starting hex (roll 1d10)
1-4: Grassland (color: lightgreen)
5-6: Forest (color: darkgreen)
7-8 Hills (color: brown)
9: Marsh (color: #6b4423)
10: Mountains (color: grey)
### Next hexes (roll 1d10; Look at the previous hex)
1-5: Same as previous hex
6: Grassland
7: Forest
8: Hills
9: Marsh
10: Mountains
### How to Generate the first batch
Hexes will have a flat top and bottom. Use the first table to generate the first hex of the map. (Ex: a 3 is rolled: the biome of the first hex is grassland.)
Then, generate the 6 hexes around it by rolling on the second table. Start with the one on top then continue clockwise, until you have 7 hexes. (Ex: the rolls are 2, 9, 9, 6, 7, 3 and translate to grassland, marsh, marsh, grassland, forest, grassland.)

### How to Generate the second batch
Until now, the “previous hex” was always the same: the central one. But from now on, it will vary and will each time be one of the previously generated hexes. The map will go through an intermediate form, which looks like a snowflake with 6 points.
The north-most hex will generate the hex to the north of it. The hex in the upper right will generate the hex to the upper right of it. The hex in the lower right will generate the hex to the lower right of it. etc.
Once these 6 hexes have been generated (the “points” of the snowflake), moving clockwise, roll for the remaining (ungenerated) hexes using the proper starting points.
### How to Generate the third batch
After this step, the hex map will have reached an interesting size (19 hexes). We recommend stopping at this point. To further expand the hexcrawl, repeat the procedure several times and stick the resulting hex maps together if desired.
### Numbering the hexes
When numbering the hexes, the initial hex is 1, the hex to the north of it is 2, move clockwise (3, 4, 5, 6, 7), and when you have numbered that circle of hexes, move north again, that would be 8, and continue clockwise (9, 10...18, 19)

## High-Level Approach

1. **Biome Generation Rules**
    
    - **Starting Hex** (roll 1d10 on the first table).
    - **Subsequent Hexes** (roll 1d10 on the second table, using the “previous hex’s” biome as a reference).
2. **Layout / Numbering**
    
    - **Center Hex = #1** at axial coordinate (0,0)(0,0)(0,0).
    - **First Ring = #2..#7**.
        - Use the six “flat-topped” directions: (0,−1), (1,−1), (1,0), (0,1), (−1,1), (−1,0) (0,-1),\,(1,-1),\,(1,0),\,(0,1),\,(-1,1),\,(-1,0)(0,−1),(1,−1),(1,0),(0,1),(−1,1),(−1,0)
        - Top neighbor is #2, then proceed clockwise to #7.
    - **Second Ring = #8..#19**.
        - The second ring has 12 hexes, all coordinates at distance 2 from the center (0,0)(0,0)(0,0).
        - We list them in a **clockwise** loop starting from the top-most coordinate (0,−2)(0, -2)(0,−2).
    - For each new hex in ring 1 or ring 2, find which hex is the “parent” (the hex one ring closer to the center that is adjacent). Use that parent’s biome for the “previous hex” logic.
3. **Drawing Flat-Topped Hexes**
    
    - The coordinate-to-pixel transform for **flat-topped** axial (q,r)(q,r)(q,r) can be: x=xoffset+32×q×size x = x_{\text{offset}} + \frac{3}{2} \times q \times \text{size}x=xoffset​+23​×q×size y=yoffset+3×(r+q2)×size y = y_{\text{offset}} + \sqrt{3} \times \left(r + \frac{q}{2}\right) \times \text{size}y=yoffset​+3​×(r+2q​)×size This places the “top” of the center hex horizontally flat and ensures that (0,−1)(0,-1)(0,−1) is directly above (0,0)(0,0)(0,0).
4. **Snowflake Growth** (Just for clarity)
    
    - After generating ring 1 from the center, ring 2 is generated by enumerating all coordinates whose distance from (0,0)(0,0)(0,0) is 2, in **clockwise** order, each time using the closer hex from ring 1 as the parent for the biome roll.
